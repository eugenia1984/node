# NodeSchool Workshops

For a wide variety of practical community-sourced workshops, take a look at [NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io/). This community creates (usually) free events around the world where mentors help guide others through workshops. However, every workshop is meant to be self-guided. Each workshop is installed using npm install, this adds a CLI for that workshop which can then be executed to start the workshop.

Bear in mind this community project has been on-going since 2013 and is managed by volunteers, therefore some content may be out-dated. Nevertheless, it's a highly informative free resource that can be used to explore not just Node but various parts of the JavaScript (and WebGL and Web Assembly) ecosystem.

# Making Open Source Contributions

One of the most practical ways to learn and grow around any technology is to get involved in contributing to open source projects. In the previous chapter we covered some points around etiquette from a contribution perspective and the social contract around consuming open source.

In this section we'll briefly discuss how to select an open source project to contribute to, as a way to expand our practical knowledge with Node.js. We discussed how to assess the quality of a package in the prior chapter. Be sure to differentiate between quality and personal preference. Always use the same stylistic choices as the author when making PRs. It's perceived as inconsiderate to reformat code to a different style to the code in the repository. However, feel free to, for instance, add CI integration to a repo if it's missing (although open an issue to ask first to see if the maintainer is active or disinterested). If a package is severely lacking when it comes to the quality checklist, this might not be a good project to attempt to contribute to.

It's important to recognize the human element. OSS is a collaborative process so effective communication is key. Before contributing to a project, look at how maintainer's communicate with people who open issues and PRs. Do PRs land or are they ignored or closed without discussion? Does the maintainer make efforts to communicate professionally even if there is disagreement? Does the maintainer make efforts to explain reasoning? Do they give helpful feedback on PRs?

If we're wanting to learn by contributing, these are the key elements we need to look for. It is possible to have a bad experience contributing to an OSS project, in the same way it's possible to have a bad experience with anything involving communication with people. In those cases, find something else to contribute to.

The issue tracker is sometimes helpfully labelled by maintainers (this is a good sign), look for labels that say "good first issue". These are excellent ways to get started with a project as the maintainers have already signalled that they'd appreciate any help from those who aren't (yet) experts. The https://goodfirstissue.dev/ site has a limited (curated) number of repositories where it indexes "good first issues" of participating projects. This can be a good starting point.

Contributing to successful OSS projects is a good way to learn by osmosis, but it is unstructured learning. There's no guarantee and no expectation that any maintainers should take time to teach, however they are often incentivized to explain specific concepts that relate to their project. Purely contributing to open source (and likewise, learning on the job) does leave room for knowledge gaps. For foundational learning it's hard to beat structured study. In the next section we'll talk about certified training options.

# Getting Certified

The [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/) and the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) offer two Node.js trainings, [Node.js Application Development (LFW211)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/nodejs-application-development-lfw211/) and [Node.js Services Development (LFW212)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/node-js-services-development-lfw212/), as well as two certifications, [OpenJS Node.js Application Developer (JSNAD)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/jsnad/) and [OpenJS Node.js Services Developer (JSNSD)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/jsnsd/).

Both certifications have been designed to remain agnostic to problem-solving methodologies.

The Node Application Developer training and certification covers a broad range of Node.js use cases. The topic domains for JSNAD and the weightings (marking ratio) are shown in the following table:

The Node Services Developer training and certification focus only on building HTTP services in a secure manner. Topics and weightings are illustrated in the following table:
