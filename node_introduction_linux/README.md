## Course Overview

As the language of the Internet browser, JavaScript is ubiquitous and Node.js is an asynchronous, event-driven, JavaScript runtime. Software engineers from all backgrounds have touched JavaScript at some point. Using a common-place, easy-to-learn language as the basis
of a runtime environment for manipulating machine I/O has some interesting and wide-ranging
productivity benefits.

Node.js has qualities that can make it particularly useful in various scenarios. From service-mocking, rapid-prototyping and real-time applications to building Command Line Interfaces in a short time to accessing a plethora of ecosystem utilities. This course allows the learner to learn about the fundamentals of Node.js and discover ways it can help in everyday computing scenarios.
